# 2022 Oslo PER Summer Institute Machine Learning Short Course

Welcome to the 2022 [Oslo PER Summer Insitute](https://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/about/news-and-events/events/2022/oslo-per-summer-institute-2022.html). We are all excited to have you join us this year!

This short course will focus on the essential aspects of machine learning that are likely to feature in a variety of research areas that you might interact with.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this four day short course, you should be able to:

* Read data into a pandas DataFrame
* Clean data and impute data (as needed)
* Plot data and propose potential models for analysis
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Build classification and regression models
* Evaluate the quality of fitted models

## Organization of the Course

The course will be conducted over the next four days. We will meet in person and we will make use of Jupyter notebooks, so you will need to make sure that you have installed the [Anaconda distribution of Python with Jupyter](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or something equivalent. The course is broken down into 4 topics:

1. Day 1 - [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Working with Data](./notebooks/day-1/Day-1_Exploring-data-with-Pandas.ipynb)
2. Day 2 - [Building a Regression Model](./notebooks/day-2/Day-2_Multiple_Regression.ipynb)
3. Day 3 - [Building a Classification Model](./notebooks/day-3/day-3_KNN_classification.ipynb)
4. Day 4 - [Using A Multiplicity of Models](./notebooks/day-4/Day_4-Multiplicity_of_Models.ipynb)
